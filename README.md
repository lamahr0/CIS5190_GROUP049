# Project Oil Temperature Prediction Project 
Project Oil Temperature Prediction Project 

This repoistory is created to fullfill the requirements for the CIS5190 Project. <br>

This project presents a study on the problem of forecasting oil temperature. Oil temperature can be used as a proxy to predict electrical energy use. Forecasting electrical energy use is an important problem in the energy sector because accurate predictions of electrical energy use can help lower the cost of electricity for customers by providing electric producers with an accurate estimate of the forecasted electricity demand. This, in turn, can lead to reduced losses in the electricity grid, which would translate to lower costs for the end consumer as well. <br>


Dataset:<br>

The dataset used can be found the following repoistory: https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset/. 
* ETT-small/ETTh1.csv was used for the training of all models
* ETT-small/ETTh2.csv was used to check the data shift
